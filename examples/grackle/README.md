# Grackle parameter files

Files in here were used to make the cooling tables used by the Grackle
chemistry and cooling library. Files ending in "mf" refer to the
metal-free version where all elements other than H/He were disabled.

* noUVB(_mf).par - collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE, i.e., no radiation) run
* hm_2012(_mf).par - Haardt & Madau (2012) UV background run
* fg_2011(_mf).par - Faucher-Giguerre (2011) UV background run
* metal_free.dat - commands to disable metals in Cloudy
* HM12_UVB - directory with Cloudy-readable spectra of Haardt\Madau background
* FG11_UVB - directory with Cloudy-readable spectra for FG2011
* background
